# This folder contains python scripts to generate synthetic iptable rules. We generate these rules based on several criteria.


## Criterion 1: Making the default rule to PKT DROP

## Criterion 2: Block certain ip addresses

## Criterion 3: Allow trafic from certain port ID (e.g., SSH, HTTPS, HTTP)

## Criterion 4: Load Balancing 

## Criterion 5: Port forwarding
